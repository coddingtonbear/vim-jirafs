vim-jirafs
==========

This plugin allows you to execute Jirafs commands while editing ticket files
within vim.

Quickstart
----------

For example, to ``submit`` your ticket
(running ``submit`` runs both  ``commit`` and ``push`` your changes to JIRA),
you could run::

    :Jirafs submit

Note that you can use any command other than ``submit``, too.
